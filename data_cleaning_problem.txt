## Data Cleaning Interlude  

You're going to work to create a dataset with a "career outcome" for each player, representing the highest level of success that the player achieved for **at least two** seasons *after his first four seasons in the league* (examples to follow below!). To do this, you'll start with single season level outcomes. On a single season level, the outcomes are:  

- Elite: A player is "Elite" in a season if he won any All NBA award (1st, 2nd, or 3rd team), MVP, or DPOY in that season.    
- All-Star: A player is "All-Star" in a season if he was selected to be an All-Star that season.   
- Starter:  A player is a "Starter" in a season if he started in at least 41 games in the season OR if he played at least 2000 minutes in the season.    
- Rotation:  A player is a "Rotation" player in a season if he played at least 1000 minutes in the season.   
- Roster:  A player is a "Roster" player in a season if he played at least 1 minute for an NBA team but did not meet any of the above criteria.     
- Out of the League: A player is "Out of the League" if he is not in the NBA in that season.   

We need to make an adjustment for determining Starter/Rotation qualifications for a few seasons that didn't have 82 games per team. Assume that there were 66 possible games in the 2011 lockout season and 72 possible games in each of the 2019 and 2020 seasons that were shortened due to covid. Specifically, if a player played 900 minutes in 2011, he **would** meet the rotation criteria because his final minutes would be considered to be 900 * (82/66) = 1118. Please use this math for both minutes and games started, so a player who started 38 games in 2019 or 2020 would be considered to have started 38 * (82/72) = 43 games, and thus would qualify for starting 41. Any answers should be calculated assuming you round the multiplied values to the nearest whole number.

Note that on a season level, a player's outcome is the highest level of success he qualifies for in that season. Thus, since Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was both All-NBA 1st team and an All-Star last year, he would be considered to be "Elite" for the 2022 season, but would still qualify for a career outcome of All-Star if in the rest of his career he made one more All-Star game but no more All-NBA teams. Note this is a hypothetical, and Shai has not yet played enough to have a career outcome.   

Examples:  

- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Rotation (3), Roster (4), Roster (5), Out of the League (6+) would be considered "Out of the League," because after his first four seasons, he only has a single Roster year, which does not qualify him for any success outcome.  
- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Starter (3), Starter (4), Starter (5), Starter (6), All-Star (7), Elite (8), Starter (9) would be considered "All-Star," because he had at least two seasons after his first four at all-star level of production or higher.  
- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Starter (3), Starter (4), Starter (5), Starter (6), Rotation (7), Rotation (8), Roster (9) would be considered a "Starter" because he has two seasons after his first four at a starter level of production. 

### Question 3  

**QUESTION:** There are 73 players in the `player_data` dataset who have 2010 listed as their draft year. How many of those players have a **career** outcome in each of the 6 buckets?
